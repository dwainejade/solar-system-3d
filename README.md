### TODOS

- [x] Add labels to planets
- [x] Match realtime orbit speeds
- [x] Implement onclick interactions for detailed planet information
- [ ] Angle orbit paths to reflect real orbital inclinations
- [x] Save and manage planet positions
- [ ] Integrate gravitational force
- [ ] Change orbital paths to dynamic trails
- [ ] Allow users to adjust the Moon's orbital radius
- [ ] Incorporate data from the NASA API
